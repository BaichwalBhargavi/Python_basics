# üêç Python Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey**!  
This repo is a collection of small scripts, examples, and notes as I explore Python step by step.  
It includes everything from basic syntax to algorithms.

This repo is mainly for my personal learning,
but feel free to open issues or suggest improvements.
